The potential earnings for a woodworking business specializing in chopping boards and coasters can vary widely depending on several factors such as your production capacity, pricing strategy, marketing efforts, and market demand. Here's a rough estimate based on common industry practices:

1. **Pricing Strategy:** Determine the price range for your chopping boards and coasters. High-quality, handcrafted wooden items often command premium prices, especially if they feature unique designs or use exotic woods. For example, a high-end chopping board could be priced anywhere from $50 to $150, while coasters might range from $15 to $40 for a set.
    
2. **Production Capacity:** Estimate how many units of chopping boards and coasters you can produce in a month. This will depend on factors like the size of your workshop, the availability of materials, and the skill level of your craftsmen. Let's assume you can produce and sell 50 chopping boards and 100 coaster sets per month.
    
3. **Sales Forecast:** Based on your pricing and production capacity, calculate your potential monthly revenue. For example, if you sell chopping boards at $100 each and coaster sets at $30 per set, your monthly revenue could be:
    
    - Chopping boards: 50 units * $100 = $5,000
    - Coaster sets: 100 sets * $30 = $3,000 Total monthly revenue: $5,000 (chopping boards) + $3,000 (coaster sets) = $8,000
4. **First Year Projection:** Assuming consistent production and sales, your first-year revenue could be around $8,000 per month * 12 months = $96,000.
    

Keep in mind that these are rough estimates and actual earnings can vary. Factors like seasonal demand, market trends, and competition can also impact your sales. Additionally, as your business grows and gains traction, you may be able to increase prices or expand your product line, which could lead to higher earnings in subsequent years.
