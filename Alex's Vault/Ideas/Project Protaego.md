### Name Ideas

Arcanus - hidden, secret, private, mysterious, intimate, personal, confidential

Praetago - cover, hide, defend, protect, guard against

- Praetago is taken.
- Protaego is the next viable candidate, domain names available.

## Description

Project Praetago (name pending), a privacy-driven social network

## Implementation Phase 01

Create a relatively standard social network except only user has decryption key

- User has traditional username and password, but also a crypto key which is used to decrypt their profile
- The user owns the data, only downfall initially is that the data will be host on AWS or AZURE

## Implementation Phase 02

Create a decentrialised social network using PKI?

- Easy to use, remove all technical jargon
- User authenticates with user file - contains public key and 'configuration' file
- Device contains NFC tag and user configuration, the user profile tag could be accessorised
- Praetago is hosted on TOR node

## Design Notes

1. No ownership of data
2. Each users data profile is a separate entity
3. Users 'configuration' (friends, liked pages, etc) are saved locally on the device
4. Users under the age of 16 must have tag purchased and authenticated using parents crypto key

## Challenges

1. Monetization - People are used to not paying for social media, do not understand that their data is being sold.
    - Subscription based
2. User uptake - It is critical that the interface is simple to use and approachable. Key features are highlighted and easy to use

Probe potential user uptake via a survey

## Strategy

1. Design simple app, decryption key resides on user's device, uses unique value on phone as Initialisation vector
2. Audience perception has to be shifted to realise that they are the product, data is being sold by
3. Use funds gained from implementation phase 01 to fund phase 02
