The essential 8 is a model used to assess an organisations cyber worthiness against 8 essential mitigation strategies. Each mitigation strategy is then assessed against a FOUR tiered maturity level scheme with Maturity Level 0 being the most urgent with an organisation having the highest risk of a breach and compromise of the CIA triad (confidentiality, integrity, availabity).

The essential 8 comprises of 8 mitigation strategies, with these being:

- **Application Control** - Application is implemented on workstations and servers to restrict executables, scripts, etc.
- **Patch Applications** - Patches are applied within 2 week or within 48 hours in an exploit exists
- **Configure Microsoft Office macro settings** - Microsoft office macros are disabled for users that do not have a demonstrated business requirement.
- **User application hardening** - Web browsers do not process java from the internet, web browsers do not process web ads from the internet.
- **Restrict administrative privileges** - Requests for privileged access to systems and applications are validated when first requested.
- **Patch operating systems** - A vulnerability scanner is used daily in OSâ€™ of internet facing services, patches are applied within 2 weeks from release or 48 hours if a known exploit exists.
- **Multi-factor Authentication** - MFA is used to connect to an orgs internet facing service
- **Regular backups** - backups are performed and retained and coordinated within business continuity requirements
