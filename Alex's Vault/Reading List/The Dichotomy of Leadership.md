# Key Points

- The best leaders and teams acknowledge mistakes, take ownership, and make corrections to improve. Over time this adds up.
- Cover and Move: Teamwork is critical among departments and groups.
- Simple: Complexity breeds chaos and disaster - keep things simple and communicate overall intent.
- Prioritize & Execute: accomplish highest priorities in series.
- Decentralized Command: empower team leaders by clearly communicating what to do and why.

### Chapter 1 - The Ultimate Dichotomy

- You should get close to your employees, your team, but never forget there is a job to be done, and that the good of the company/mission needs to come first.

### Chapter 2 - Own It All, but Empower Others

- You must avoid both micromanagement and being too hands-off.
- Give clear guidance on the mission, the goal, and the end state, as well as the boundaries in place.
- Make sure to communicate what other teams are doing.
- Continue to monitor progress, but try and refrain from giving specific guidance on execution unless necessary.

### Chapter 3 - Resolute, but Not Overbearing

- Leaders must set high standards and drive the team to achieve those standards, but they cannot be domineering or inflexible on matters of little strategic importance.
- The most important explanation a leader can give to the team is “why?"
- This is particularly important when holding the line and enforcing standards.
- Keep in mind every leader has a limited amount of “leadership capital”, which must be expended carefully, only on important things.

### Chapter 4 - When to Mentor, When to Fire

- Most underperformers don’t need to be fired, they need to be led. But once every effort has been made to help an underperformer improve and all efforts have failed, a leader has to make the tough call to let that person go.
- Leaders are responsible for getting their individual team members to perform through coaching, mentoring and counselling.
- However, once every avenue is pursued without improvement to a sufficient level, leaders must put the team first and remove the individual.

### Chapter 5 - Train Hard, but Train Smart

- Training must be hard. Training must simulate realistic challenges and apply pressure to decision-makers. _There is no growth in the comfort zone_.
- Training must focus on the fundamentals.
- Training must be repetitive.
- The best training programs are not orchestrated from the top down, but driven from the bottom.
- “We don’t have the budget” and “we don’t have time” are not valid excuses. Role-playing is free and training is important - make time.

### Chapter 6 - Aggressive, Not Reckless

- Problems aren’t going to solve themselves—a leader must get aggressive and take action to solve them and implement a solution.
- An aggressive mind-set should be the default setting of any leader. Default: Aggressive. This means that the best leaders, the best teams, don’t wait to act.
- “Aggressive" means proactive. It doesn’t mean that leaders can get angry, lose their temper, or be aggressive toward their people.
- The aggression that wins on the battlefield, in business, or in life is directed not toward people but toward solving problems, achieving goals, and accomplishing the mission.
- It is also critical to balance aggression with careful thought and analysis to make sure that risks have been assessed and mitigated. The dichotomy with the Default: Aggressive mind-set is that sometimes hesitation allows a leader to further understand a situation so that he or she can react properly to it.
- To be overly aggressive without critical thinking is to be reckless.
- Be particularly cautious when you’ve had a few successes; the “disease of victory” can cause overconfidence and underestimation of risks.

### Chapter 7 - Disciplined, Not Rigid

- Disciplined standard operating procedures, repeatable processes, and consistent methodologies are helpful in any organization.
- Disciplined procedures must be balanced with the ability to apply common sense and deviate from SOPs when necessary.
- Freedom to think about alternative solutions and make adjustments must also be encouraged.

### Chapter 8 - Hold People Accountable, but Don’t Hold Their Hands

- Use accountability as a tool when needed, but don’t rely on it as the sole means of enforcement, lest it consume all a leader’s time.
- Balance accountability with educating the team on _why_ and empowering members to maintain standards even without direct oversight from the top.

### Chapter 9 - A Leader and a Follower

- Leaders must be willing and able to lead.
- However, they must be willing to lean on expertise and ideas of others more experienced, even if more junior.
- They must also follow their own leaders: you must execute senior ideas as if they are your own once they are decided upon.

### Chapter 10 - Plan, but Don’t Overplan

- Careful planning, preparing for likely contingencies and never taking anything for granted is essential to succeeding.
- However, you must focus on the most likely scenarios - perhaps 3-4 likely ones, plus the worst-case.
- Too much planning and the process becomes unfocused and overwhelming. Too little, and you will fail.

### Chapter 11 - Humble, Not Passive

- Humility is the most important quality in a leader.
- However, you must not be so humble as to be passive - when necessary, push back, voice concerns, stand up and provide feedback.

### Chapter 12 - Focused, but Detached

- Leaders must be attentive to details and in touch with the front lines, but must also keep the bigger picture in mind.
